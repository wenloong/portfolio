## Portfolio Project

### Description

This portfolio website was made to showcase all my side projects I do along side school as well as details about me. I made this from scratch from designing to coding every bit of it. I plan to update this website every now and then depending on the current website trend or any new knowledge learned on the way of my studies as a Computer Science and Engineering student at UCR.
